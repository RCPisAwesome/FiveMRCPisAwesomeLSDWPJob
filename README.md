## Roleplay Potential:
If this job was added to NoPixel it would create a brand new way of players getting rewarded for playing a fun mini game.
It combines the existing jobs, illegal and legal together by giving the potential to get any items you would get from those jobs.
It also takes the players all over the map in a fun and unique way so they can get familiar with the map.
Players may have to go to pools in private residences that are owned by other players, this would give them the ability to roleplay their job fully by asking to go see their pool and maybe even "charge" them for the work for a little extra money. Equally the owner could refuse and the employee could try to convince them to agree, there's many avenues the roleplay could turn. They may also encounter other players while on other jobs whom they can also roleplay with.

Given the opportunity of being a developer, I would also like to take this one step further, playing a character who runs the LSDWP. I would be managing the 3 LSDWP buildings in Vinewood, Rancho and Zancudo above the military/AIRX base. I would be roleplaying my character based on the information that can be found on the [GTA Fandom Wiki](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Los_Santos_Department_of_Water_%26_Power). I would have the duty of assigning jobs to employees instead of it being a fully open job, to put it bluntly I would keep the grinders at bay as the job could be very overpowered if farmed, given the items you can potentially receive. Alternatively the items and pay you're able to receive could depend on if your an whitelisted employee of the LSDWP or not. Some other duties could be getting the vehicles repaired at mechanic shops, there would be a shared garage similar to that of the PD on NoPixel. This could also allow players to buy and use their own LSWDP vehicles so they could upgrade and personalise them.

On top of all the aforementioned points there is much more potential with the illegal side of this job, which my character would be fully aware of. Players could sell me the items they get at a slightly better price than the existing sale spot, commonly referred to as the "fence". On top of that with a little modification it would be possible to give players specific job locations and receive specific items from them. This would be a very good method of distributing and selling illegal weapons and items as the job would act as a good cover. This could even be a way of getting gun part items, or materials the same as the existing gun crafting, which then could be sold to me and I could craft them into functioning weapons. Although gun crafts already exist it doesn't hurt to have competition or variety in weapons. This crafting area could be in an interior linked to a door on any and all the 3 LSDWP areas, they all have suitable buildings. It would also be nice to clean up and improve each of the areas, which I could do, but that it not as important.

## Walkthrough:
1. The job starts at the Vinewood LSDWP building where you sign on by walking up to the NPC, you are given one of two types of vehicle.
2. You are given a job based on the water type (see table lower down) and then a random job area of that type.
3. You will receive the area on the map, drive to it.
4. Once in the area you will be given a specific spot to head to. For island jobs you also get a jetski to head to the island's area.
5. Stay in the spot to start the minigame.
6. In the minigame you have to catch the item, the progress bar appears above the item and you have to fill it.
7. During the game the spot may change, the minigame will pause and you will have to head to the new spot to resume it.
8. Each item will add or subtract points and when the points reach 0 the game ends.
9. You then return the jetski to the vehicle, if you had an island job, and return the vehicle to the front of the LSDWP building to complete the job.

## Minigame Controls:
- Hold the left mouse button down to move the net up and release it to let the net float down.
- You can use the commands /dwppause and /dwpplay to pause and play the minigame.
- Pause button on the screen to the right of the points scoreboard.
- Click the gear to toggle settings menu.
- In the settings menu there is a toggle for move mode which lets you move the minigame or the notification list around the screen.
- There are also volume sliders for each of the sounds.

## Configuration for NoPixel:
The script by default is a standalone script but it should be very easy to integrate with NoPixel's system. The spots are marked with comments to replace the sections that need replacing. I would be more than happy to fully integrate it personally given the opportunity.
- Main loop for signing on replaced by targeting and phone code.
- Inventory item notifications replaced by the giving of the items.
- Add more items and replace existing item names in item list in the javascript file with the real names, at current they are just guesses.
- Ability to abandon the job.
- Optional:
  - Payment in cash or to the bank for completing the job.
  - Help text notifications replaced by hud text notification system.
  - Crash safety so player's dont lose progress if they disconnect.
  - Compatibility for up to 4 people in group.
  - Some kind of displayable document to show that the employee is in fact working for LSDWP.

## Configuration of Client.js:
- Item list is fully configurable, see lower down for details.
- The net and item are build for classes, their properties are fully changeable in each class constructor
# TODO

## Configuration of Items:
- Items are first sorted by whether they are illegal or legal and then by their rarity common to ultra rare, in the table they are represented as numbers.
- Each item requires it's name in plural form as the key and a table with a points and an image key defined within it, e.g. "tests":{"points":1, "image":"testimage"}
  - Points is the number subtracted from the total points upon fishing out the item, can be negative to give points too
  - Image is the partial url of a google emoji from [emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/google/)
- An item can also have the additional keys:
  - Location is the water types in the order they are in the job coords list
  - Givesitem is the how you give inventory items to the player, the amount is random between the minimum and maximum 
  - Givesmessage is the message you want attached to the item, shown in the notification
  - Singular by default the singular name takes off the last letter of the name but this overrides that so that it can make sense grammatically. It can also be a negative number to take off that many letters or 0 to not change it from the default plural.
  - Annota replaces "a" with "an" in the notification when it's a single item
  - Somenota replaces "a" with "some" in the notification when it's a single item
  - Overrideamount overrides the number shown on the notification which otherwise would use the amount from the numbers in Givesitem
  - Breakimage breaks up the image in the notification, this simulates the item being broken down into the items it gives.

## Configuration of Job Coords List.lua:
Job Coords List.lua is a list of all x and y coordinates of the vertices of every job area possible and is split into water types. It is best to use the dev tools to show the jobs to edit, remove or add new areas.

## Configuration of Client.lua:
In Client.lua the percentage chances of getting each water type is listed in the percentages table at the top, they match the order the types are in the job coords list.

Default Percentages:
Place|Type|Chance
:---:|:---:|:---:
1|pool|50%
2|water treatment|1%
3|monument|5%
4|fountain|5%
5|pond|5%
6|vespucci canal|1%
7|canal|3%
8|boat dock|1%
9|stream|3%
10|river|3%
11|lake|3%
12|sea|3%
13|marsh|3%
14|beach|5%
15|rocky beach|3%
16|concrete|1%
17|island|5%

## Failure Cases:
It is possible to fail the job by one of the following instances occurring:
- The player dies
- The vehicle is destroyed or despawned
- The jetski, if one, is destroyed or despawned

## Possible Additions/Changes:
- A list of all items showing which ones have been found
- A list of total amounts of each item found
- Multiple items in water at once
- The minigame difficulty scales based on illegality and rarity

## Other Jobs From LSDWP That Could Be Added:
- Testing water for chemicals
- Cleaning the water treatment areas more in depth
- Cleaning water walls like around the southern docks
- Cleaning water towers
- Cleaning piers
- Cleaning the yachts
- Cleaning empty pools and maybe refilling them
- Electrician job, could tie into the restoring of power to the city
